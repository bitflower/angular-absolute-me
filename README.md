Absolute Me !
=============

Absolute Me! sizes your target DOM elements with cleverness! Let your favorite layout system like BootStrap, Foundation, etc. do the relative sizing. Get absolute sizes when the page is loaded or when the resizing of the browser is finished. 

Szenarios when Absolute Me! can help:
-------------------------------------
- Turn a relatively sized element to position: fixed on scroll actions (e.g. ui-scrollfix, headroom.js, ...)


Pros:
-----
- no scope polution
- no performance eater (no dom adjustsment during resize event fire)
